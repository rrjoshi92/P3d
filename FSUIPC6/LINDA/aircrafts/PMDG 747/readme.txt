How does the CHKL/VS function work?
There has to be a switch definded which toggles between CHKL and VS
(in my default assignment it is the CWSA button on the MCP Combo2)

Pressing this switch toggles then the mode between VS (vertical Speed) and CHKL (Checklist),
but only for the 748.

in VS Mode, dialing the VS knob changes the VS. Pressing is similar to MCP VS Switch press.
in CHKL Mode dialing the VS knob will move the CHKL Cursor, pressing will make a selection in the CHKL.
